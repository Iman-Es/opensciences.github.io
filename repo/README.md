# PROMISE repo: opensciences.githib.io

## Step1: become a colloborator of this repo

+ Email any member of the [current writers](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io/graphs/contributors)
  asking for access.
  
## Step2: Open two windows in a browser:

+ The [forms entry screen](http://openscience.us/repo/contribute/donate) for the repo
+ The [issues list](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io/issues) for the repo

Note that your mission is to take the papers maked in **yellow** in the 
issues list and enter their details into the **forms entry sceen**.

A little background is needed to explain the colors in the issue list. These color are assigned by the PROMISE custodians as they work on who gets to read what appers. First, they find a conference. Then, they bust up the table of contents into chunks (of, say, 20 papers each) after which someone has a quick peel to see if any have data. If they do, then they get marked in yellow in the issue list.

## Step3: Repeat till Bordered

Find any yellow issue (the "the may have datalabel)
