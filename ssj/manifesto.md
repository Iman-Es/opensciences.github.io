## Why This Journal?

To paraphrase Jean-Jacques Rousseau, _Ideas are
born free, and everywhere they are in chains_. Some
ideas take too long to reach publication while other
ideas can never be published due to the narrow focus
of current publication formats. Worse, after
publication, those ideas may be locked away behind
subscription-based firewalls that make them hard to
access.

Enough is enough. As academics,
we make the most contribution to these
publications.
As software engineering (SE) researchers, we volunteer our labor to write,
review, and edit the papers. We staff the editorial
boards. We even train the next generation of
researchers to write the next generation of papers.
Also, many of the services that
[publishers reportedly offer](http://goo.gl/T6mJsX)
are, in the particular case of software engineering,
handled by us, free of charge. For example:

+ Previously there was a need for paid production
   teams to produce camera-ready copy. However, as
   shown with our conference papers, software
   engineering academics can generate high-quality
   copy using free tools.
+ As to indexing and distribution services, ISSN
  numbers and DOI numbers can be organized, free of
  charge.
+ Also, there now exists free-of-charge storage
  facility [arXiv.org](http://arXiv.org) and
  indexing/search tools
  ([scholar.google.com](http://scholar.google.com)
  for our papers.

In short, we can are free to change the nature of
our publication forums -- just by deciding to do so.
Our proposal to change the nature of publication
rests on the idea that a traditional paper is actually
an end report generated after using  many
[research products](researchproducts.html).


This rest of this page:

+ Describes this concept of
  [research product](researchproducts.html).;
+ Lists problems with our current publication methods;
+ Discusses how to use [research products](researchproducts.html).
  to address those problems.

## Research Products

If we only share our papers then that is like a software company
only distributing their binary files. If someone else wants
to modify and improve that code, they need more than just
the binary.
They need all the _intermediary products_ used along the way
to generate that binary.

As with software, so too with research papers about software.
Our final papers are the result of applying  a large set
of
[research products](researchproducts.html) to some task.
The premise of SSJ is that
_each of those products are worth reviewing and sharing_.

Note that some of these
[research products](researchproducts.html)
do not fit
into a conventional research paper. For example,
until very recently, it was not standard to post the scripts
and data used to generate research papers. That is changing,
slowly, but we want to encourage the whole research community
to let more people access and critique and improve all
[research products](researchproducts.html).

So the goal
of SSJ is to provide a forum where researchers are
rewarded for  creating and sharing high quality
[research products](researchproducts.html),
which can then be used and improved by the broader
research community.

And if we create such a forum, it would solve many open issues
with how we publish research...

## Research Products: Solving Open Issues

### Issue #1: Publications are too Dependent on Fee-for-Service Organizations


According to the Whitehouse Office of Science and Technology,
["citizens deserve easy access to the results of scientific research their tax dollars have paid for"](http://goo.gl/wlMKP). Yet
many scientific results are locked away behind
firewalls.  The fee-for-service publishing houses
[boast exorbitantly large profit margins][taylor12] for the
publications of our papers: mean figures from
Elsevier, Springer, and John Wiley Sons over the
last decade range from [33 to 42 percent][goats11]. 
ACM and IEEE,
while not for profit, are likewise fee-for-service.
These costs are increasing.  For example, at
[Harvard University][harvard12],
prices for content from two providers
have increased by about 145 over the past six years,
which exceeds not only the consumer price index, but
also the higher education and the library price
indices.



_SOLUTION #1_:
Replace all the pay-for-publication infrastructure
with a free-to-use infrastructure.  Reduce the effort
involved with moving some research product through
that infrastructure by dividing our current "papers"
into many smaller
[research products](researchproducts.html).


### ISSUE #2: Lack of Control of Publication Policies

Here is a small example of very widespread problem:
In 2010, the editors of this journal were part of a
team of half a dozen prominent SE researchers that
tried to convince three leading SE journals to
change their _short paper_ policy.  The proposed
change was that "papers under 4 pages will be
reviewed in one month".  This proposed change was
motivated by a desire to:

1. increase the currency of recent publications;
2. engage more with our industrial colleagues who 
   find it easy to contribute to such a shorter format.  

The proposal was discussed, at
length, with the editors of the ASE journal, IEEE
TSE, and EMSE.  Those editors expressed interest in
the idea but commented they were unable to effect
that kind of editorial change without clearing it
with the publisher.  In the end, this proposal was
never implemented, despite the interest expressed by
those editors and despite the ardent advocacy of
prominent and active SE researchers. 

This is a troubling story.  Even though we
generate and moderate the content of our
publications, we cannot change even small details on
how that content is collected and
disseminated. Clearly, it is time for a change.

_SOLUTION #2:_
Take back control of how our research
content is disseminated.  

+ Step away from the
infrastructure offered by the fee-for-service
publishing companies.  
+ Create a free  infrastructure
for the dissemination of research results (this web site and this journal).
 Reduce the effort
involved with moving some research product through
that infrastructure by dividing our current "papers"
into many smaller
[research products](researchproducts.html).
+ Run a bi-annual town hall meetings
with researchers in order to give a broad community
control of the policies of that infrastructure.

###  ISSUE #3: Too Little Interaction Between Industry and Academia 

Consider the 
large industrial SE community engaged in
software innovation.  These developers  are responsible for
innovations that have changed how software is
developed and how we interact with that software
(e.g. the iPhone interface from Apple; agile and
open-source development practices and tools such as
GitHub; exabyte-level cloud storage; industrial
mega-scale data mining at Google, Yahoo, and
Microsoft; etc). A common complaint from
those innovative developers is that academic
software engineering papers published in conferences
and journals are irrelevant and removed from their
needs, interests, and results.

_SOLUTION #3:_
Remove the barriers that block our industrial
partners from participating in academic forums.
Increase the currency of our research papers by
decreasing their review times.  Shorten the format
of research papers so industrial developers may have
enough time to write them. Divide standard paper
formats into many, much smaller sets of
[research products](researchproducts.html) 
and
allow for separate submission of each smaller part.


### ISSUE #4: Too Few Replicated Studies 

There are very few replications of prior SE results.
For example, in 2010, [Robles][robles10] published a
retrospective study of the 171 papers published in
the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference [106].
He found that over 95 of those papers were
unreproducible, since their associated data was no
longer on-line.  This lack of availability of old
MSR data was discussed, at length, at MSR 2013.
According to those participants, the single biggest
contributor to this issue was the lack of a
free-to-use long-term storage facility for big
files.  For example, free services like GitHub or
GoogleCode impose limits of just a few gigabytes on
the total repository size.

_SOLUTION #4:_ 
Create a large free-to-use repository for SE
[research products](researchproducts.html).  To this
end, we have created a
[large repository for storing the data](https://terapromise.csc.ncsu.edu/svn/repo),
plus creating
[a discussion site](http://openscience.us/repo/) for
those contents calculate, that this repository
requires one petabyte of storage.

### ISSUE #5: Incomplete Descriptions

The traditional research paper is the final step in
a long process. Yet it only reports the last few
steps and not all the other 
[research products](researchproducts.html) 
that are needed to reproduce, improve, or refute the
original work.  Note that incomplete descriptions
also contributes to the **Too Few Replicated Studies**
problem.

_SOLUTION #5:_
Allow researchers to store all the 
[research products](researchproducts.html) 
 in a repository.  Offer prominent and public
awards to researchers who contribute such products.

It should be added here that we recognized that our
industrial colleagues can make significant
contributions to academic research, even if their
local restrictions prevent them from contribution
proprietary products to the repository. Therefore
our editorial policies will allow papers that
comment on no repository products (in fact, we plan
to reach out to industrial contacts and encourage
such papers).

### ISSUE #6: Slow writing times

Many of our industrial contacts complain that the
standard conference/journal paper (10 to 20+ pages
of motivation + related work + results + future work
+ conclusion) takes too long to write.

_SOLUTION #6:_
Divide a researcher's work into small
[research products](researchproducts.html), 
each of which can be
peer-reviewed and published. For a list of our
proposed 
[research products](researchproducts.html).  Note that
since our _publishable unit_ can be shorter than the
standard format, we predict that more people will be
able to participate.
For example, we would accept papers that:

+ Motivate some industrially-based challenge
problem; or
+ Report a successful reproduction of prior work; or
+ Show drawbacks with a particular statistical
test.  

That is, this infrastructure would enable
rapid peer review and publication of submissions
that are only as long as necessary to comment on any
one (or more) of the products listed in types.

### ISSUE #7: Slow review times

It is an anachronism that, in the age of the
near-instantaneous world-wide connectivity, it still
it takes many months to years to get a conference or
journal paper accepted.

_SOLUTION #7:_
As discussed above, the journal
supports shorter papers, thus enabling shorter review
times (e.g. one month, or less, for each four pages
of submitted material).  This, in turn, 
decreases the "cycle-time" between (a) original
idea and (b) eventually dissemination would be
reduced.

Since publication cycles are shorter,
industrial practitioners have faster access to
results.  Also, researchers can use the journal
for on-going debates with peers to get earlier
feedback on their work.

### ISSUE #8: New Modes of Communication are Under-Utilized

When academics meet at conferences, there is much
they can learn from their face-to-face
interactions. Unfortunately, many researchers cannot
attend conferences.  Given the time and cost
involved, it is too expensive for a research lead to
take their entire research lab to all the
conferences. Hence, often only the research lead
benefits from the personnel connections at
conferences.  This is particularly true for
academics from traditionally under-represented
groups with fewer economic resources.

In this age of widespread social media, it is
possible that useful teams can form between
academics, without needing to meet face to
face. Such an approach to research can reduce the
cost of collaboration and allow more human resources
to be applied to current research issues.

_SOLUTION #8:_
Publish [research products](researchproducts.html) using the
workflow and discussion tools developed in the agile
software community (e.g. 
[the GitHb repos](https://github.com/opensciences/opensciences.github.io) 
we use to host this web site).  In this way, researchers need
not travel to conferences in order to have extensive
interactions with other researchers from around the
world.  Instead, they could benefit from the same
style of rapid and broad scale interaction available
to open source developers.

One example of such a workflow and discussion tool
is GitHub. Used by 3.4 million users, GitHub is fast
become the defacto standard for collaborators
sharing the details of their software products.  Our
current version of  the journal, can
be found on the web at
[http://openscience.us/ssj](http://openscience.us/ssj).
