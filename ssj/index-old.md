Science Journal (SSJ) provides an international
forum for the evaluation and maturation of software
engineering ideas.

The journal offers electronic and paper publication
of high-quality scholarly articles in all areas of
software engineering. All published papers are
freely available online.

SSJ has a commitment to rigorous yet rapid
reviewing. Final versions are published
electronically (online ISSN 2375-5768) immediately upon
receipt. Paper volumes are now published and sold 
on demand within Amazon (print ISSN  2375-5741).

SSJ accepts a wide variety of papers, include those
in _traditional_ and _novel_ formats:

+ A _traditional format_ paper is (say) 3000
  words describing a (1) motivational
  statement followed by (2) some related work then
  (3) a description of the study instruments and (4)
  results from those instruments then (5) a
  discussion of external validity.
+ On the other hand, _novel formats_ can be much
  more varied.  The view of SSJ is that research
  papers contain many 
   [research products](/ssj/researchproducts.html), any of
  which can be separately peer-reviewed and
  published. 

Note that since SSJ papers can be as short as a
single  [research products](/ssj/researchproducts.html), these SSJ papers can be
much shorter than other journals. Hence, SSJ can
offer faster review times for these shorter papers.
